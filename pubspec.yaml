## The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to
## pub.dev using `flutter pub publish`. This is preferred for private packages.
#publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev
#
## The following defines the version and build number for your application.
## A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
## followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
## Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
## build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
## In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
## Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
## In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
## Read more about iOS versioning at
## https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
## In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
## of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

## Dependencies specify other packages that your package needs in order to work.
## To automatically upgrade your package dependencies to the latest versions
## consider running `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions`. Alternatively,
## dependencies can be manually updated by changing the version numbers below to
## the latest version available on pub.dev. To see which dependencies have newer
## versions available, run `flutter pub outdated`.

#  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:

#    - assets/images/proImg/
#    - assets/json/service-account-file.json
#  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

#
#  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
#  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
#
#  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
#  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
#  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
#  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
